This repository contains Python programs created to practice **classes and basic object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts.

It includes:
- Creating classes and objects
- Using attributes and methods
- Understanding how classes work in Python

This project is for **learning and practice purposes** as I build my understanding of OOP.
